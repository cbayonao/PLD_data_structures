# Activities to accomplish Objectives
- Socialize conceptual deficiencies
- Clarify concepts
- Deepen the concepts
- Present an example
# Bottlenecks
- Some colleagues, although they understand how the concepts work, find it difficult to explain the essence of the concepts, so we promoted those failures by going to the board and looking for the essence of the concepts.
- On the contrary to other colleagues it happens to them that they understand the essence of the concepts, but they cannot understand how it is used so we try to make simple algorithms in order to understand the correct functioning of the concepts

# Conclusions
- The strength of learning Holberton is in the variety of ways we use to learn and the ability to understand people who solve problems differently than ours
- We can complement it and do our part by accepting there may be better ways of doing things and putting them into practice.
